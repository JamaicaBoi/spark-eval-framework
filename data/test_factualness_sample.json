OCR\ntechnology based on deep learning has gradually become a research hotspot, and is widely used in\nmany fields such as electronic bill recognition, certificate recognition, license plate recognition,\nnatural scene text recognition and so on[5]\n. Deep learning has strong image feature learning ability,\nwhich optimizes the traditional technical framework to a certain extent and improves the recognition\neffect and speed of OCR. Currently, the typical OCR recognition process includes three stages:\npreprocessing, text detection and character recognition[6]. As shown in Figure 1, the technical\nbottlenecks affecting the recognition accuracy lie in text detection and character recognition, which\nare the top priority of OCR technology research.\nFigure 1: OCR recognition process\nPreprocessing: usually it is to correct image imaging problems, including image noise reduction,\ntilt correction, blur removal, etc. At present, CNN based neural network model enhancement feature\nextraction is widely used to solve the above problems[7][8]\n.\nText detection: locate the text area in the image. Target recognition algorithm based on\nconvolutional neural network is applied to text detection. Scholars constantly propose improved\nalgorithms and adjust models, such as TextBoxes, CTPN, SEGLINK, EAST and other algorithms, to\nmake the detection results more accurate [9]\n.\nCharacter recognition: identify the text content in the image. On the basis of traditional single\ncharacter recognition, the context sequence information is introduced, and the neural network model\nCRNN, which depends on the temporal relationship, can be used to improve the accuracy of character\nrecognition[10]\n",
